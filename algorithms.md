An algorithms is a set of insturctions that is completed in a step-by-step way to solve a particular problem.

Recursion refers to a method or a function that will call itself. It is used to resolve problems by breaking the problem down into sub-problems.

- Divide and conquer

- Dynamic programming

* mainly use for optimization problems.
* split problems into sub problems

- Greeedy algorithm

* locally optimal choices
  A greedy algorithm solves a problem step by step by always picking the best-looking choice right now, without worrying too much about the future.

Greedy algorithms work only for certain problems, where:

Making the best choice now never causes regret later

A big problem can be broken into smaller similar problem

Planning is key with any algorithm. Make sure you have all the steps neatly laid out.
